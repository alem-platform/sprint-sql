Harness the power of the **Using Unicorn!**

## Instructions:

Using the `Invoices` and `Invoice_Items` tables, write a query to retrieve the `InvoiceId`, `InvoiceDate`, `TrackId`, `UnitPrice`, and `Quantity` for each invoice item. Use the `USING` clause to join on `InvoiceId`.

Order the result by the price of the unit in descending order.
