Use the `HAVING` clause with complex conditions to filter groups.

## Instructions:

Using the `employees` table, write a query to find departments where the number of employees is greater than 2 and the average salary is less than 75,000. Retrieve `department_id`, the number of employees as `employee_count`, and the average salary rounded to three decimal places as `average_salary`, ordered by `department_id`.
