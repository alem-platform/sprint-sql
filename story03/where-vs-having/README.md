| Expected file |
| ------------- |
| `where-vs-having.sql` |

Demonstrate understanding of `WHERE` vs `HAVING` by combining them effectively.

## Instructions:

Using the `employees` table, write a query to find departments that have an average salary greater than 33,333, but only consider employees who were hired after '2015-05-18'. Retrieve `department_id` and average salary rounded to a whole number as `average_salary`, ordered by `department_id`.
