# All In One

| Expected file |
| ------------- |
| `all-in-one.sql` |

Use combined filtering conditions with `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`.

## Instructions:

Using the `employees` table, write a query to find departments where:

- The average salary is greater than 70,000.
- The maximum salary is less than 90,000.
- Only consider employees in positions that contain the word 'Manager'.

Retrieve `department_id`, average salary as `average_salary`, and maximum salary as `max_salary`, ordered by `department_id`.
