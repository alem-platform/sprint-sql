## Instructions:

Using the `employees` table, write a query to find employees who work in the same department as **'Emma Clark'**. Retrieve `first_name`, `last_name`, and `department_name` retrieved from `departments` table. Sort the result by `last_name` in descending order.

## Note:

- You can use subqueries in both `WHERE` and `SELECT` clauses at the same time.
