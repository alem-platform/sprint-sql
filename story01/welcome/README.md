Welcome to the SQL Sprint! ðŸŽ‰

We will start from the basics and learn what SQL is and how to use it to manage and query databases.

### What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for accessing and manipulating relational databases.

## How to Get Started?

### For `story01`

For the first part of this sprint, you will work with an **empty database**. You will create tables, insert data, and perform basic queries.

**Instructions:**

1. **Setting Up Your Environment:**

   - You will be working with **SQLite**, a lightweight, file-based database that's easy to use and commonly installed on most machines.
   - If you don't have SQLite installed, you can download it from the [SQLite Download Page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).

2. **Create a New SQLite Database:**

   - Open your terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store your database files.
   - Create a new SQLite database file named `story01.db`:

     ```sh
     sqlite3 story01.db
     ```

   - This command opens the SQLite prompt connected to your new database.

3. **Begin Working on Tasks:**

   - Follow the instructions in each task to create tables, insert data, and write queries.
   - You can execute your SQL scripts using the SQLite command line:

     ```sh
     sqlite3 story01.db < your_task_file.sql
     ```

### For `story02` and Beyond

Starting with `story02`, you will work with **prefilled databases** that contain data already populated. This will allow you to practice more advanced queries and operations.

**Instructions:**

1. **Accessing the Prefilled Databases:**

   - The prefilled SQLite database files for each story are available on GitHub.
   - Visit the repository to download the database files

2. **Download the Database Files:**

   - Navigate to the specific database file you need (e.g., `story02.db`).
   - Click on the file and then click the **Download** button to save it to your local machine.
   - Save the database file in the directory where you will be working on your SQL tasks.

3. **Begin Working on Tasks:**

   - Use the downloaded database file to execute your queries.
   - You can interact with the database using the SQLite command line:

     ```sh
     sqlite3 story02.db
     ```

   - To execute your SQL scripts against the database:

     ```sh
     sqlite3 story02.db < your_task_file.sql
     ```

4. **Do Not Modify the Database Structure:**

   - Unless a task explicitly instructs you to do so, do not alter the schema of the prefilled databases.
   - Focus on writing queries and operations that work with the existing data.

## Working in Your Repository

For this bootcamp, you will work in the `sprint-sql` repository. Please follow these steps:

1. **Create Your Repository:**

   - For this sprint you will be working in a repository named `sprint-sql`

4. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**

   - Regularly commit your changes with clear messages.
   - Push your commits to your repository to keep your work backed up and to share with instructors or collaborators.

---

## Important Notes:

- **Consistency is Key:**

  - Use the exact database files provided to ensure your queries work correctly.
  - Do not modify the data in the prefilled databases unless a task explicitly requires it.
