May the *wand* of selection lead your way...

### Instructions:

Using the `employees` table, create a query that shows:
1. `first_name` and `last_name` combined with a space as *full_name*
2. `salary` multiplied by 12 as *annual_salary*
3. `salary` increased by 10% as *increased_salary*
4. Number of years since `hire_date` as *years_employed*, rounded down to the nearest whole number
5. `salary` divided by 20 as *daily_rate* (assuming 20 working days per month)
