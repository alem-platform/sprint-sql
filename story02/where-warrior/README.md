Master the WHERE clause with basic comparison operators.

### Instructions:

Using the `employees` table, create four separate queries to find:
1. Employees with salary greater than `55000`
2. Employees hired after `'2012-06-01'`
3. Employees in department_id `2` with salary less than `100000`
4. Employees with position containing `'Lead'`


In all queries, select the employee's first name, last name, and position. Sort them all in descending order by `position` column.
