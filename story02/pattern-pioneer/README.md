Each query should find employees:

1. Whose `first_name` starts with 'M'
2. Whose `last_name` ends with 'son'
3. Whose `email` contains '.w'
4. Whose `position` starts with 'Senior'
5. Whose `last_name` has exactly 5 characters
6. Whose `email` starts with any single character followed by 'a'
7. Whose `position` contains word 'Manager' anywhere
8. Whose `last_name` starts with 'M' or 'W' or 'R'
9. Whose `first_name` has 'li' in second and third position

Sort all queries in descending order by `position` column.
