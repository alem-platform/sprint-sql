## Core Functionality

### Has the team created an accurate Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) representing at least five entities with minimum five attributes each?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

### Does the ERD show logical relationships between entities or can the team explain them orally?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

### Have all required tables been created according to the ERD with appropriate data types and constraints (PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, etc)?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

### Are at least 15 records inserted into each table with realistic and consistent data?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

## Basic SQL Operations

### Can the team perform basic SELECT queries?
- Retrieve all columns
- Select specific columns
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

### Can the team perform basic data insertions?
- Add new records
- Maintain data consistency
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

### Are column operations and aliases used correctly?
- Concatenation
- Calculated columns
- Proper aliasing
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

### Can the team properly filter data?
- Use WHERE clause
- Compare values
- Basic conditions
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

## Advanced Queries

### Pattern Matching and Sorting
- Use LIKE operator
- Sort results
- Handle text operations
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

### Aggregate Functions and Grouping
- Use COUNT, MIN, MAX
- Group results
- Filter groups with HAVING
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

### Subqueries
- Single value subqueries
- Correlated subqueries
- Subqueries in SELECT
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

### Complex Operations
- Nested aggregates
- Date calculations
- Combined conditions
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

## Code Quality

### Are SQL scripts well-organized with clear comments?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

### Do queries handle edge cases (zero results, NULL values)?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

### Is the output properly formatted in results.txt?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

## Project Defense

### Can the team explain their database design decisions?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

### Can they explain the logic behind their complex queries?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

## Bonus Features

### Has the team implemented additional constraints?
- UNIQUE
- CHECK
- DEFAULT
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

### Are indexes created on frequently queried columns?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
